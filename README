Hi! You have a curious mind, that's good!

Disclaimer:
pom.xml should also contain plugin / targets for deploying to AppEngine, starting local dev server, etc. But it doesn't. I dont use it, I deploy directly  from IntelliJ Idea and it simply works for me. I use Maven only as a dependecny management tool. Let your Idea import this project from local pom.xml and you should be fine.

The best way how to use this example is to go through it's source code, think about it, understand it and then decide to do things your way :-)

Good luck!

P.S. Don't hesitate to ask me, the worst thing that can happen is that I won't answer.
