Hi! You are curious mind, thats good!

Disclaimer:
pom.xml should also contain plugin / targets for deploying to AppEngine, starting local dev server, etc. But it doesn't, I dont use it, I deploy from IntelliJ Idea and it works for me. I use maven only as a dependecny management tool. Let your Idea import project from local pom.xml and you should be fine.

best way to use this example is to go through it's source code, think about it, and then decide to do things your way :-)

Good luck!

P.S. Don't hesitate to aks me, the worst thing that can happen is that I won't answer.
